### Here are the instructions for the group project

#### Overview and getting started

1. Read through Group Project Description

2. Create a new GitHub repository on one team member's account and add the other team members as collaborators

3. Read the introduction and conclusion of Scolnic et al (2018)  (Links to an external site.)and check out figures 11 and 18 so you have some idea what's in the paper. It's a long one and you do not need to read and understand the whole paper. 

4. Familiarize yourself with the astronomical and cosmological concepts you will need for this project (most important: redshift, apparent magnitude, LCDM, curvature, Hubble's constant, and the relationship between the parameters Omega_m and Omega_Lambda and the mass densities rho_m and rho_Lambda). You can use your team members for this.

5. Think about what needs to be done to complete this project and identify pieces that you are interested in working on.

#### Project Plan

1. Develop a plan with your group for completion of your project, all the way through to delivery of the in-class presentations on May 7th and delivery of code and presentation slides on May 8th.
2. Do this synchronously (all together at the same time, from your remote locations). LK suggests a Google doc will be easier for this synchronous and remote development than VC under git.
3. Break down the work to be done into a set of tasks. 
4. For longer tasks, further break them down to subtasks by identifying intermediate milestones.  
5. Associate a person responsible for the completion of each task and subtask. 
6. Identify any possible dependencies such as Task X needs to be completed before Task Y can start.
7. Identify any questions that need to be addressed before the plan can be finalized. Create a plan for getting those questions answered.
8. Think about how you want to structure your repository.
9. While planning, keep in mind that you want to have code development under VC and you want to use some kind of code review as part of your process.
10. How is your team going to ensure the quality of the presentations? You might want to schedule a presentation review.
11. Write up a complete description of your plan that describes all the tasks and subtasks, planned completion dates, and responsible parties. 
12. Push this plan to your repo and also upload it to Canvas.

### code and results

You should submit the following by pushing to your group repository by the due date :

1. Classes (optional) and functions
2. Top level calls to produce the results
3. Testing
Each of these components should be submitted as separate files unless you choose to do everything in a single notebook.

Your code will be evaluated on:

1. Code should be readable and easy to follow. Use explicit variable names and comments as needed
2. All classes (if you use them) and functions should have docstrings
3. Write unit tests for your code that test the basic functionality of each function and class (you do not need to think about edge cases and corner cases).
4. Each test should end in an assert statement that the function produces the expected result
5. Correctness of methods and results
6. Demonstration (via git log) of development under version control
